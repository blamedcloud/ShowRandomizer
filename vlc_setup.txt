In order to use the play_show.play method, your vlc will need to be configured
so that it closes after it finishes playing it's playlist.

In order to configure this, follow the following steps (or google around for
the right setting if this doesn't work exactly):

1. open vlc
2. op the top bar, go to
    Tools -> Preferences
3. in the bottom-left corner of the window that pops up, select the 'All' button
under 'Show settings'
4. in the left menu, scroll until you find the 'Playlist' option, and select it.
5. ensure that the 'Play and exit' checkbox is checked.
6. hit the 'Save' button in the bottom-right corner

The important thing here is that the 'Play and exit' option is turned on. If the
menu navigation above doesn't match up exactly to your vlc version, then look
around for that option or google how to turn it on.
